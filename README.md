## Contents 

This repository contains code that we did during Programming Level 2 in Grade 12!

Most of the code is in Swift and the main framework that we used in the class is SwiftUI. 

See Canva for my slide deck for my app idea. I pitched this app during the *Final Showcase* in June 2025. 

## Context 

I learned Swift this semester. Throughout the term, I learned how to use the language to build unique interfaces!
